1497679.EP56_07450	dtd	151	An aminoacyl-tRNA editing enzyme that deacylates mischarged D-aminoacyl-tRNAs. Also deacylates mischarged glycyl-tRNA(Ala), protecting cells against glycine mischarging by AlaRS. Acts via tRNA- based rather than protein-based catalysis; rejects L-amino acids rather than detecting D-amino acids in the active site. By recycling D- aminoacyl-tRNA to D-amino acids and free tRNA molecules, this enzyme counteracts the toxicity associated with the formation of D-aminoacyl- tRNA entities in vivo and helps enforce protein L-homochirality.

1497679.EP56_11450	topB	714	Releases the supercoiling and torsional tension of DNA, which is introduced during the DNA replication and transcription, by transiently cleaving and rejoining one strand of the DNA duplex. Introduces a single-strand break via transesterification at a target site in duplex DNA. The scissile phosphodiester is attacked by the catalytic tyrosine of the enzyme, resulting in the formation of a DNA- (5'-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate and the expulsion of a 3'-OH DNA strand. The free DNA strand then undergoes passage around the unbroken strand, thus removing DNA supercoils. Finally, in t [...]
