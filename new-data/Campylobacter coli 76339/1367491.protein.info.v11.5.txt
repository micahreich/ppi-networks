Catalyzes the coordinated movement of the two tRNA molecules, the mRNA and conformational changes in the ribosome
1367491.BN865_15940c	rpsG	156	One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, it binds directly to 16S rRNA where it nucleates assembly of the head domain of the 30S subunit. Is located at the subunit interface close to the decoding center, probably blocks exit of the E-site tRNA
